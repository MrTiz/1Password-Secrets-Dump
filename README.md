# 1Password Secrets Dump

The 1Password password manager client keeps a lot of sensitive information in memory, such as credentials or any other type of document saved within the database.

A local user with **administrative privileges** can exfiltrate many of the secrets kept by 1Password by performing a memory dump of the `1Password.exe` process.

## About the issue

_When you view an item in 1Password, the information must be decrypted for you to see it. 1Password temporarily stores this information in your computerâ€™s memory while 1Password is open._

_This means that while 1Password is open, itâ€™s possible for someone who has access to your computer to read that information from your computerâ€™s memory. Under normal circumstances, only you have access to that information. This is how all software works._

**N.B.** <u>Keep in mind that since version 7.4.750 for Windows, process memory is cleared much faster than in previous versions</u>. This was the result of what has been a long-term and ongoing project to rewrite 1Password for Windows in Rust [[kb/201902a](https://support.1password.com/kb/201902a/#update-highlights)].
So the ability to properly exfiltrate credentials is also a matter of luck as it is important to be able to run the script before the secrets are deleted from the process memory. Otherwise, you can schedule the script to run automatically at regular intervals or to run based on the visibility or focus of the client window. ðŸ˜‰

## Known issues
- If any of the fields within the JSON objects to be exfiltrated contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., emoji) pattern matching will fail!
